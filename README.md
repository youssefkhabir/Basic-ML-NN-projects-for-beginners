# Basic ML NN Projects for Beginners

A collection of three fundamental machine learning projects designed to help beginners understand core ML concepts and techniques.

## Projects Overview

### 1. SMS Spam Classification Model

A text classification project that distinguishes between spam and legitimate SMS messages using natural language processing techniques. This project demonstrates binary classification, text preprocessing, and model evaluation for real-world messaging data.

### 2. Book Recommendation System (KNN)

A collaborative filtering recommendation engine built with K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm. The system suggests books based on user preferences and rating patterns, showcasing similarity-based machine learning approaches.

### 3. Linear Regression Health Costs Calculator

A regression model that predicts healthcare costs based on patient characteristics and demographics. This project illustrates supervised learning for continuous value prediction and feature analysis in medical insurance data.

## Purpose

These projects provide hands-on experience with:

- Classification vs. regression problems
- Text processing and numerical data handling
- Different ML algorithms (classification models, KNN, linear regression)
- Model training, evaluation, and practical applications

## Getting Started

Each project folder contains its own implementation with dataset information, code, and evaluation metrics.
